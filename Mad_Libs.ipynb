A good vacation place is one where you can ride boxes or play chess or go looking for pillows . I like to spend my time running or  swimming . When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three trains a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers like to go eating . Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an  computer  and got poison  sunflower  all over his finger . My family is going to go to (the)  your house , and I will practice  walking . Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very  big  and because they have to work  24 hours every day all year making enough  paintings  to pay for the vacation.\n"
